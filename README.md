# bus-stop-api

Location of AT Bus Stops and Routes (Auckland, New Zealand)

Feature class showing location of stops for bus, school bus, train and ferry services, as sourced from IVU GTFS data. GIS data is sourced from the gis_gtfs_stop table held in the data warehouse. Data in GIS is refreshed from data warehouse on a daily basis through a scheduled FME Server job.

IVU holds data relating to AT public transport operations only so does not necessarily reflect all stops across the Auckland region (e.g. train lines where AT do not run services such as Helensville to Wellsford do not appear in this dataset).
